## San Francisco Compute

We run affordable pre-training clusters for startups, grad students and research labs.

We sell compute by the hour, not by the year. Need 768 H100s for a week? You got it. Want to do 32 runs on 8 H100s for 2 hours each? Sure. 
You can flexibly burst to large portions of the cluster so you can scale up your model without having to sign an expensive long-term contract.
